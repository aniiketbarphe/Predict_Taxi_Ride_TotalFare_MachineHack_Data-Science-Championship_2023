# Predict_Taxi_Ride_TotalFare_MachineHack_Data-Science-Championship_2023

**1) Problem Statement:-**

As a student, you've undoubtedly hailed a ride when you're late for class or heading out for a late-night study session. Ever wondered how the total cost of your ride is determined? Well, it's time to switch gears from passenger to predictor. In this thrilling hackathon, you'll put your data science skills to the ultimate test by predicting the total fare of a ride-hailing trip. 🎯 🚖
 🛠️💼📚:
 
**2) About the Dataset:-** Dataset contains following files,

**2.1) Train:-** 209673 rows x 8 columns

**2.2) Test:-** 89861 rows x 6 columns

**2.3) Data description:-**

⏱️ **'trip_duration':** How long did the journey last?

🛣️ **'distance_traveled':-** How far did the taxi travel?

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **'num_of_passengers':-** How many passengers were in the taxi?

💵 **'fare':-** What's the base fare for the journey?

💲 **'tip':-** How much did the driver receive in tips?

🎀 **'miscellaneous_fees':-** Were there any additional charges during the trip?

💰 **'total_fare':-** The grand total for the ride (this is your prediction target!)

⚡ **'surge_applied':-** Was there a surge pricing applied? Yes or no?

**2.4) Output feature (Target feature):-**

**a) fare:-** Identify the input features in the dataset and use them to predict the "fare" of a trip.

**b) total_fare:-** Once the "fare" is predicted, then calculate "toatl_fare" using other inputs. (like fare, tip & miscellaneous_fees)

**3) Evaluation metric:-** The submission will be evaluated using the RMSLE metric

**4) Public and Private Split:-**

a) This hackathon supports private and public leaderboards
b) The public leaderboard is evaluated on 30% of Test data
c) The private leaderboard will be made available at the end of the hackathon which will be evaluated on 100% of Test data
