# Predict_Taxi_Ride_TotalFare_MachineHack_Data-Science-Championship_2023

🎉🎉 Attention all student data whizzes! We are beyond excited to kick off the "Data Science Student Championship 2023". This year's challenge? A real head-turner: Predicting the 'total_fare' for taxi rides! 🚖
As a student, you've undoubtedly hailed a ride when you're late for class or heading out for a late-night study session. Ever wondered how the total cost of your ride is determined? Well, it's time to switch gears from passenger to predictor. In this thrilling hackathon, you'll put your data science skills to the ultimate test by predicting the total fare of a ride-hailing trip. 🎯
This championship is designed not just to put your skills under the microscope, but to refine them, strengthen them, and prepare you for real-world problem-solving scenarios. And that's not all! You'll be delving into a fundamental issue in the world of transportation economics.
Here's a quick look at your toolbox for this challenge 🛠️💼📚:

⏱️ 'trip_duration': How long did the journey last?
🛣️ 'distance_traveled': How far did the taxi travel?
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 'num_of_passengers': How many passengers were in the taxi?
💵 'fare': What's the base fare for the journey?
💲 'tip': How much did the driver receive in tips?
🎀 'miscellaneous_fees': Were there any additional charges during the trip?
💰 'total_fare': The grand total for the ride (this is your prediction target!).
⚡ 'surge_applied': Was there a surge pricing applied? Yes or no?
📣 The contest will kick off on May 19, 2023, and runs through June 11, 2023.
Get ready to put on your data scientist hat 🎓📊, because your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to construct a machine learning model that uses these parameters to predict the 'total_fare'

What is the metric in this competition? How is the leaderboard calculated?
The submission will be evaluated using the RMSLE metric. One can usenp.sqrt(mean_squared_log_error(actual, predicted)) to calculate the same.
This hackathon supports private and public leaderboards
The public leaderboard is evaluated on 30% of Test data
The private leaderboard will be made available at the end of the hackathon which will be evaluated on 100% of Test data
The Final Score represents the score achieved based on the Best Score on the public leaderboard
